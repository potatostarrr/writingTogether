### Content Introduction
1.	Mini lesson. In a traditional writing classroom, teachers always spend about 10 minutes teaching students some writing strategies. And teachers use the rest of time for writing tasks, reading, and writing activities. In order to take advantage of the abundant writing resources and ease the burden of writing teachers, some the video clips in mini-lesson can be borrowed from Youtube or other websites while some of them can be created and recorded by teachers themselves for reuse at any time for students, especially for some students who cannot fully master the content.  
2.	Writing topic. Writing topic is open platform for students and teachers. Researches find out that students are more motivated to write if they can choose the topics they want to write. Students and teachers can freely type down their favorite topics and one student can see other’s topics. If some students don’t have no idea of what to write, they can refer to other’s topics to gain some inspirations. 
3.	Discussion board. The main purpose of creating a discussion board for students is to provide different form of writing opportunity. Another reason is that every student can get involved into this writing activity since some students who don't like answer teachers’ questions orally and publicly may prefer to type their answers in discussion board.
